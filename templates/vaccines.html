        <h1>COVID-19 vaccination in India</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>On 16 January 2021 India started its national vaccination programme against the SARS-CoV-2 virus which has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. The drive prioritises healthcare and frontline workers, and then those over the age of 60, and then those over the age of 45 and suffering from certain comorbidities.[2] In January 2021 Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres said that India's vaccine-production capacity is the best asset the world has.[3] According to health officials, India has administered 7,30,54,295 (73 million)[a] vaccine doses across the country as of 1 April 2021.</p>
        <h2>Development</h2>


        <p>Pune-based Serum Institute of India announced that it would apply for clinical trials of certain strains from Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) in April 2020. As per company president Adar Poonawalla, a vaccine for COVID-19 will be delivered within a year. However, it may not be effective on 20 to 30% people. Two other companies are also trying to develop a vaccine: Zydus Cadila, which is replicating viral vector vaccine and developing a DNA plasmid vaccine, and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, in collaboration with US based FluGen, which is expecting the first clinical trials of a nasal vaccine by late 2020. As of late February, the Serum Institute of India had begun animal trials of vaccine candidates, followed by Zydus Cadila in March. ICMR partnered with Bharat Biotech in May to develop COVID vaccine completely in India. Till May, there were over 30 candidates of COVID-19 vaccine in development in India, many of which were already in pre-clinical tests. Per reports emerged in July, ICMR was preparing to launch BBV152 COVID vaccine or Covaxin, India's first COVID-19 vaccine on 15 August following its ongoing human trials in July. Although, later deadline was cited as only meant to cut "red tape" and expected timeline of any Indian vaccine not to be before 2021.[14] COVAXIN has been reported to have positive results on animals in building immunity against COVID-19 in pre-clinical trials.[15] In mid-July, Zydus Cadila too had followed with human trials of its vaccine named ZyCoV-D.[16] In early August, SII's got approval from DCGI for trial phases II & III.[17] SII has also joined GAVI in a partnership with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to produce 100 million doses of vaccine for developing countries.[18]

            In September, India's science minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan announced that the first vaccine for use will be available by first quarter of 2021. 30 million health workers directly dealing with COVID patients, especially doctors and other medical personnel are supposed to be first to receive the vaccine.</p>

        <h3>COVID-19 vaccines with approval for emergency or conditional usage</h3>
        <h4>Covishield</h4>
        <p>On 1 January 2021, the Drug Controller General of India, approved the emergency or conditional use of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine AZD1222 (marketed as Covishield).[21] Covishield is developed by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech.[22] It’s a viral vector vaccine based on replication-deficient Adenovirus that causes cold in Chimpanzees. It can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (2°C-8°C/ 36°F-46°F). It has a shelf-life of at least six months.</p>

        <h4>Covaxin</h4>
        <p>On 2 January 2021, BBV152 (marketed as Covaxin), first indigenous vaccine, developed by Bharat Biotech in association with the Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology received approval from the Drug Controller General of India for its emergency or conditional usage.[23] However, this approval was met with some concern as the vaccine had not then completed phase-3 trials.[24] On 3 March 2021, Bharat Biotech announced that interim results of Covaxin showed the 81% efficacy. Trial was conducted on the 25,800 people in India.[25]</p>
